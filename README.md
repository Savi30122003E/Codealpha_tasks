# Codealpha_tasks
An intern experience to work on the following projects.
Three pyhton programs are attached here.
1.Hangman
A program based on the random module getting input from the user to guess the word with a limit of 6 chances.The correct answer displays a message of "You win!" and the wrong one as "You lose!"
2.A basic chatbot
The chatbot was totally basic and it built using the libraries of python where it will enagage you with a greet and where you may ask your requirements here.I include the list of streams in computer science and whenever you need to quit you can wave a bye.
3.Task automaiton step(For file organising)
